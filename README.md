# Iris-Flower-Classification

This project demonstrates a supervised machine learning approach to classify Iris flower species using various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, etc.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

- Distribution plots for each feature ( KDE Plots )
- Correlation heatmap
- Checking for missing values and data imbalances

## Results

A comparison of models is done based on performance metrics. The best-performing model was chosen based on **F1 score** and **F1 test Gap**.
